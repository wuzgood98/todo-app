## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I learned about the HTML Drag and Drop API which enables applications to use drag-and-drop features in browsers. The user may select draggable elements  with a mouse, drag those elements to a droppable element, and drop them by releasing the mouse button. A translucent representation of the draggable elements follows the pointer during the drag operation. You can customize which elements can become draggable, the type of feedback the draggable elements produce, and the droppable elements.

### Useful resources

- [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv7pvH1O5Ho&t=533s) - This helped me for implementing the drag-and-drop feature for this project. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
